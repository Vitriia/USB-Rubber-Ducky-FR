Loads both HiD and Mass storage capabilities. 
	              Speed improvement makes Ducky MSC(Mass Storage) 2x faster.
	              Speed Tests: average read/write 150-155KB/s
	              (Previous results were 88KB/s, results are from a working 
		      sdcard supplied with the Ducky)
		      
		      
This was another one of my goals (in addition to several requests). Got a working PoC in time for the 1-year anniversary! (Originally, I was holding this back as a X-mas gift. But someone quick spotted it, as I was cleaning up the SVN). So I decided to publish a little earlier.
Version 2 has added improvements - multi OS support, downside memory is limited to 4KB (2048 key presses).
Nicknamed * The Twin Duck * as it functions as 2x separate Duckies; its primary function is mass-storage, and the HID attack is auto-triggered.
