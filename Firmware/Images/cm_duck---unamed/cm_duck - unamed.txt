Twin+DetourDuckv2 -   Produced due to demand: a merge of the multi-duck, and the 
		      twin-duck firmwares.
		      Duck will initially mount as Mass Storage Device.
			*Numlock  - triggers payload 1 (inject.bin)
			*Capslock - triggers payload 2 (inject2.bin)
		      Due to memory restrictions, as both payloads are loaded into 
		      Ducky memory - you are limited to 2048-Bytes 
		      of instructions per inject-payload!
		      Also only one payload can be triggered, so you have a choice 
		      payload A or payload B. NOT BOTH!!!


Requested after the success of Twin Duck (c_duck.hex). This firmware has a HID keyboard with two keyboard triggers and mass storage.

This firmware attempts to merge Twin and Detour Ducks into one firmware.

    NUM_Lock - Triggers inject.bin (limited to 2KB of instructions)
    CAPS_Lock - Triggers inject2.bin (limited to 2KB instructions)

Special Requests
S001

People were worried about driver load times affecting their payloads. So S001 uses keyboard LEDs as the HID trigger; NUM/CAPS/SCROLL LOCK all trigger 1x payload inject.bin.
S002

People were worried about driver load times affecting their payloads. So S002 uses the Ducky's GPIO button as the HID trigger; for payload inject.bin.
